Makes a Simile Timeline in WOrdPress

== Description ==
The Simile Timeline plugin was developed as part of the JISC Funded World War One Centenary project led by the University of Oxford (http://http://ww1centenary.oucs.ox.ac.uk/). 

Simile Timeline makes an editor for the MIT Simile timeline within WordPress. You can see more about the MIT Simile project at http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/.

Although the editor doesn't support all features, it makes timeline creation more simple than writing javascript natively and supports displaying it on a WordPress site.

The interface is still relatively complicated, and it is likely we will improve this code to help make this part simpler - this tool was written to help us display timelines, and so it is written for us to use. We've shared the plugin so as to help others, but please remember that it isn't a trivial piece of work to create a timeline.
